The legend of the golem originates as far back as the Middle Ages, when Jewish mystics imagined the creation of a clay humanoid as a meditative technique for becoming closer to God. By the nineteenth century, popular Yiddish folktales characterized the golem as a helper, companion, or rescuer of an imperiled Jewish community. In this exhibition, Weitz revitalizes golem mythology to frame a moral imperative for action on the social and ecological issues we face today.",

Mima\u2018amaqim , translated alternatively as \u201cfrom [or out of] the depths\u201d or de profundis , is a concept that evokes deep valleys, dark places, and mysteries. For several months, David worked in the deep storage of the Magnes, finding, researching, looking at, and drawing objects from the four corners of the world. Each drawing session culminated in a conversation with Francesco, who expanded on and played with the origins and meanings of the objects he portrayed. This installation is the result of their collaboration. Artifacts, drawings, and annotations open a window into the process of bringing out the life of an object, unleashing its performative powers. The conversation is by all means not over.",

Live Archive explores collective public archives, personal memory, and the role of photography and collecting in contemporary art and identity. Chicago-based Lazarus is known for using both traditionally developed photography and found and solicited images and texts in collaborative installations and innovative crowd-sourced, online community projects. Lazarus\u2019 work simultaneously directs attention inward toward the personal and outward toward the historical. The three main aspects of the exhibition map onto three key elements of the Jewish experience: memory, prophecy, and learning. The exhibition is organized by the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.",

The objects on view range from those associated with daily ritual, such as the mezuzah , to more festival-specific objects, such as the etrog box used during the harvest festival of Sukkoth. Rendered in metal and inspired by the architect\u2019s commitment to a modernist aesthetic, this collection is characterized by the clean lines, rational proportions, and smooth, unembellished surfaces that also define Saitowitz\u2019s architecture.",
