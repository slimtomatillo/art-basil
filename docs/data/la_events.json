The show comes to The Broad directly from the 60th Venice Biennale (2024), one of the most prestigious exhibitions of visual art in the world, where Gibson made history as the first Indigenous artist to represent the United States with a solo show at the US Pavilion. Gibson\u2019s practice celebrates individuals and communities who have maintained their dignity and traditions in impossible circumstances, centering the resilience present in the legacies of Indigenous makers. He juxtaposes a variety of texts, from foundational legal documents to quotes from civil rights activists to pop song lyrics, combining American, Indigenous, and LGBTQ+ histories with references to popular subcultures, literature, and global artistic traditions.",

            "name": "Mickalene Thomas: All About Love",
            "venue": "The Broad",
            "description": "Debuting at The Broad with over 90 works made by the artist over the last 20 years, Mickalene Thomas: All About Love is the first major international tour of this pioneering artist\u2019s work. The exhibition highlights how Mickalene Thomas has mastered and innovated within several disciplines, from mixed-media painting and collage to installation and photography. The exhibition shares its title and several of its themes with the pivotal text by feminist author bell hooks, in which love is an active process rooted in healing, carving a path away from domination and towards collective liberation. Through her queries into pop culture and mass media, Thomas offers a reverberating demand for Black women to be seen and understood, and for viewers to become what hooks calls \u201cpractitioners of love.\u201d Born in 1971 in Camden, New Jersey, Thomas completed her MFA from the Yale University School of Art in 2002 and a residency at the Studio Museum in Harlem in 2003. Soon after, she became well known for her large-scale acrylic paintings of Black women in states of leisure and repose using rhinestones, a central material in her practice that symbolizes the complexities of femininity. Depicting women with confident and assured expressions, the subjects of her works are often seen in domestic interiors from Black America, claiming the agency of womanhood while deconstructing the art historical canon. Similarly, Thomas\u2019s photographs, collages, and figurative paintings often re-stage scenes from 19th-century French painters such as Henri Matisse and \u00c9douard Manet, pushing back against the subjugation and oppressive narratives upheld by Western archives, cultural institutions, and representation systems. The Broad\u2019s debut of Mickalene Thomas: All About Love reflects some of the artist\u2019s earliest inquiries into visual culture, sexuality, and memory, and move into the present. On view is the early photographic triptych, Lounging, Standing, Looking (2003), a piece which depicts the artist\u2019s own mother, exploring kinship and care. These modes of intimate relations come to inform work such as Portrait of Maya No. 10 (2017) from the Broad collection. This acrylic and rhinestone work embodies Thomas\u2019s signature ability to apply several layers of material and symbolic meaning into a single surface. At eight feet tall, the subject is empowered, sparkled, and poised, commanding her outward gaze. Unifying these larger-than-life subjects together in the museum\u2019s galleries, the show envelops viewers into the bold and dynamic universe the artist has created, where steadfast love overcomes political strife. The themes of the exhibition extend into a full slate of associated programming developed in collaboration with the artist, including a summer concert series featuring Flo Milli and a tribute to J Dilla, a comedy night under the stars co-curated and hosted by Chaunt\u00e9 Wayans, wellness and healing events with Tai Beauchamp and Angela Manuel Davis, and additional programs and workshops centering women and Black and queer communities.

            "name": "Desire, Knowledge, and Hope (with Smog)",
            "venue": "The Broad",
            "description": "The Broad is pleased to announce Desire, Knowledge, and Hope (with Smog), an exhibition drawn entirely from the Broad collection, showcasing works by Los Angeles-based artists. Drawing its title from a John Baldessari work, the exhibition includes reflections on LA as a city in flux, and on societal issues that extend far beyond it. The exhibition will be on view throughout the museum\u2019s first floor galleries through April 7, 2024, and includes the work of 21 artists across varying generations who were raised in the Los Angeles area, such as Doug Aitken and Lari Pittman, or relocated to the city, including Catherine Opie and Mike Kelley. Desire, Knowledge, and Hope (with Smog) is made possible in part by generous support from East West Bank, Leading Partner of The Broad for six years. Organized by The Broad\u2019s Curator Ed Schad and Curatorial Assistant Jennifer Vanegas Rocha, the exhibition will feature several artists new to The Broad collection, including Njideka Akunyili Crosby, Sayre Gomez, and Joe Ray. It provides visitors the opportunity to discover how the museum\u2019s collection continues to evolve, welcoming new voices and supporting some of the most ambitious artists working in Los Angeles. Originally the exhibition was a Spring 2020 show poised to open when the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, leaving the project unrealized. Now re-envisioned, Desire, Knowledge, and Hope (with Smog) mines the paradoxes captured in Baldessari\u2019s title through a more expansive, post-2020 lens featuring a wider spectrum of LA-based artists and practices in the evolving Broad collection. Including works made from 1969 to 2023 that span the mediums of abstract or photorealistic painting, photography, sculpture, and political signage, the exhibition contains fragments, attitudes, and everyday experiences absorbed and worked through in Los Angeles that reflect back on our collective present moment, and invoke alternate histories, states of mind, and futures. The presentation highlights over 60 artworks\u2013most of which will be on view at the museum for the first time\u2013exhibiting artists in the Broad collection whose work makes some of the city's integral contributions to contemporary art internationally, and revealing dialogues between local artists of different generations. Even works not explicitly about Los Angeles reveal a gap between the allure and the reality of life in the city, where a sense of phantasmagoric projection contrasts against much harder, concrete realities. The show\u2019s title refers to Baldessari\u2019s monumental work Buildings=Guns=People: Desire, Knowledge, and Hope (with Smog) (1985), where \u201csmog\u201d nods to the city\u2019s notorious air quality, contrasting against familiar depictions of sunshine, beaches, Hollywood, and nature. This play between an idealized expectation of LA and its gritty reality is evident in the large-scale paintings, photographs and neons of Ed Ruscha, Mark Bradford, and Patrick Martinez whose intergenerational exchanges consider global and local societal issues through a shared home. Hung alongside Baldessari\u2019s work are two pieces by Mike Kelley, notably including his six-part drawing Infinite Expansion (1984), which is connected with one of his earliest performance works exploring psychedelia at The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. Other featured artists include Barbara Kruger, who will have a gallery dedicated to her work Untitled (I shop therefore I am) (1987-2019). On view at The Broad for the first time, this work uses the parlance of political signage to probe commerce and the formation of identity. Toba Khedoori will present large-scale paper works Untitled (park benches) (1997) and Untitled (Black fireplace) (2006), both of which depict scenes of quietude or isolation, experiences often associated with the sprawling geography of Los Angeles. In two works from 2022, Diamonds and Pearls and The Whole Wide World is a Haunted House, Sayre Gomez deploys a realist style using airbrushed paint. Both of his works take on the overlooked perspective of the pedestrian, where street-level views of an abandoned strip mall and nail salon signage unambiguously embrace the complex social arrangements of a shared, sweeping metropolis. FREE ADMISSION TO DESIRE, KNOWLEDGE, AND HOPE (WITH SMOG) While collection exhibitions at The Broad are always free, advance tickets are encouraged and available here for reservation.

            "name": "Keith Haring: Art Is for Everybody",
            "venue": "The Broad",
            "description": "The Broad presents the first-ever museum exhibition in Los Angeles of Keith Haring\u2019s expansive body of work and features over 120 artworks and archival materials. Known for his use of vibrant color, energetic linework and iconic characters like the barking dog and the radiant baby, Haring\u2019s work continues to dissolve barriers between art and life and spread joy, all while being rooted in the creative spirit and mission of his subway drawings and renowned public murals: art is for everybody. Curated by Broad curator and exhibition manager Sarah Loyer, the exhibition explores both Haring\u2019s artistic practice and life, with much of the source material for the exhibition coming from his personal journals. Divided into ten galleries in total, the expansive exhibition features the breadth of mediums Haring worked within, including video, sculpture, drawing, painting, and graphic works, as well as representations from the artist\u2019s enormous output of public projects, from the subway drawings to his public murals. Works presented span from the late-1970s when he was a student at the School of Visual Arts in New York up until 1988, just two years before the artist died from AIDS-related illness at the age of 31. Haring\u2019s participation in nuclear disarmament and anti-Apartheid movements are featured prominently in the show, as well as works that take on complex issues that remain crucial today from environmentalism, capitalism, and the proliferation of new technologies to religion, sexuality, and race. In the last gallery, significant works from the late 1980s are accompanied by framed posters illustrating the artist\u2019s activism within the HIV/AIDS crisis. Major works held in The Broad collection such as Untitled, 1984 and Red Room, 1988 are on view in addition to key loans from many institutional and private collections, including art, ephemera and documentation provided by the Keith Haring Foundation in New York, established by the artist in 1989. The show features immersive elements, such as a gallery lit by blacklight soundtracked by playlists created by the artist himself. Additionally, the Shop at The Broad has been transformed, taking inspiration from Haring\u2019s artistic retail space The Pop Shop, which first opened in 1986 in the SoHo neighborhood of New York. Following its debut at The Broad, Keith Haring: Art Is for Everybody will travel to the Art Gallery of Ontario, in Toronto, from November 11, 2023 to March 17, 2024, and to the Walker Art Center, in Minneapolis, from April 27 to September 8, 2024. Related Programs The Un-Private Collection: Bill T. Jones + Brad Gooch on Keith Haring On June 1, 2023, following the opening of the exhibition, The Broad will host an Un-Private Collection conversation at the Ace Theater downtown between choreographer and Haring collaborator, Bill T. Jones and Haring biography author Brad Gooch. The Un-Private Collection is an ongoing series of public programs The Broad began in September 2013. The series introduces audiences to the museum\u2019s 2,000-work contemporary art collection by showcasing stories behind the collection through conversations among artists and cultural luminaries. Generous support provided by The Robert Gore Rifkind Foundation. The Broad series Summer Happenings 2023 will consist of two events in conjunction with Keith Haring: Art Is for Everybody, each of which will include after-hours access to the exhibition as well as cash bars. Summer Happenings: Club 57 The Broad teams up with iconic denizen of the 1980s East Village art scene Ann Magnuson to revisit and reignite the spirit and energy of the infamous neo-Dada cabaret Club 57, which she managed and where she met and befriended Keith Haring. Expect performances and DJ sets by legendary artists who were part of the original Club 57 and who knew Haring personally, as well as subsequent generations of artists who pay homage to or embody new examples of the grit, glitter, and experimentation that proliferated at Club 57. Summer Happenings: 50th Anniversary of Hip-Hop On August 26, 2023, celebrate the 50th anniversary of hip-hop with a blowout concert on the East West Bank Plaza at The Broad. The event will feature early pioneers of hip hop as well as newer artists. Hip-hop was proliferating at the time that Keith Haring was living and working in the East Village of New York. Haring embraced the music genre and participated in the lifestyle by creating graffiti and public murals as well as incorporating boom boxes, break dancers, and other urban imagery and social commentary into his paintings. Five of Haring's paintings are named after songs by Public Enemy. Image Credit: Keith Haring, Red Room, 1988. Acrylic on canvas. The Broad Art Foundation. \u00a9 Keith Haring Art Foundation",

            "description": "William Kentridge\u2019s first monograph presentation at The Broad and his first major exhibition in Los Angeles in two decades will feature more than 130 works in an engaging and interactive design by Belgian designer Sabine Theunissen. Surveying 35 years of the celebrated South African artist\u2019s practice, this landmark exhibition includes all 18 works from the Broad collection with substantial loans from across the United States and South Africa. Curated by Ed Schad, the exhibition is organized both thematically and chronologically throughout the museum\u2019s first-floor galleries. A highlight of the exhibition is The Broad collection\u2019s 30-minute five-channel video and multimedia installation The Refusal of Time (2012). Kentridge grew up in Apartheid-era Johannesburg, and he has continued to live there throughout his life. His studio practice is inherently collaborative and expansive, spanning drawing, filmmaking, printmaking, sculpture, theater, opera, and installation. In addition to key drawings, sculptures, prints, and tapestries featured at The Broad, the artist\u2019s 11 Drawings for Projection films will be on view, as well as a series of films that reflect on early cinema, including 7 Fragments for Georges Me\u0301lie\u0300s, Day for Night, and Journey to the Moon (all 2003), a suite of nine short films that prominently feature the artist himself and celebrate the artist\u2019s studio as a site of experimentation and associative play. Many recent drawings will be shown that were created for his monumental performance project The Head & the Load (2018), which unearth the neglected histories of Africans and Africa in World War I. Important early works rarely or never before seen in the United States\u2014such as Domestic Scenes (1980) (54 etchings tied to Kentridge's work in theater) the Art in a State of Grace, Art in a State of Hope, Art in a State of Siege (all 1988)\u2014show Kentridge\u2019s long-lasting political engagement, upholding artistry and the creative act as its own form of transformative knowledge.

            "description": "Featuring over twenty artists, the special exhibition This Is Not America\u2019s Flag spotlights the myriad ways artists explore the symbol of the flag of the United States of America, underscoring its vast, divergent, and complex meanings. Titled after Alfredo Jaar\u2019s iconic 1987 work, A Logo for America, This Is Not America\u2019s Flag provides a critical discourse on the symbol\u2019s meaning, the complexity and contradictions of contemporary national identity, and artists as active citizens. The exhibition was developed conceptually in the summer of 2020 during the groundswell of activism for racial justice in the wake of the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor and was inspired by two works in the Broad collection, Flag (1967) by Jasper Johns and African-American Flag (1990) by David Hammons. This Is Not America\u2019s Flag presents works from over twenty artists including Laura Aguilar, Nicole Eisenman, Jeffrey Gibson, Jaar, and Johns, as well as African-American Flag (1990) by Hammons acquired by The Broad in 2019 and America (2021) by Hank Willis Thomas acquired last year. The exhibition includes works that both embrace the flag as the signifier of the nation and its ideals and subvert it to express injustices and inequities woven into the fabric of the U.S., past and present.

            "description": "Ten years ago, Eli and Edythe Broad announced the plans for this museum, to share their collection with the public in perpetuity. More than fifty years in the making, the collection, one of the most prominent collections of postwar and contemporary art worldwide, is the cornerstone of The Broad. Since Unveiling highlights artworks that have entered the Broad collection in the last decade with some as recently as this year. The fifty-three works on view by twenty-seven artists represent many facets of contemporary art, from explorations of abstraction and figuration to examinations of place, identity, and narrative. Many works witness, critique, and interpret current events, speaking to politics and power structures. Featured artists include John Baldessari, Glenn Ligon, and Kara Walker, whom The Broad has collected over decades, as well as artists added to the collection this past decade, including Tauba Auerbach, Kerry James Marshall, Catherine Opie, Nathaniel Mary Quinn, and Charline von Heyl. The exhibition features a selection of both monographic and thematic galleries, including a dedicated presentation of works by Cindy Sherman spanning the artist\u2019s career; the nine-channel HD video projection of Ragnar Kjartansson\u2019s The Visitors; a gallery with works by Gregory Crewdson, Shirin Neshat, and Nathaniel Mary Quinn that use portraiture to explore loss and longing; explorations of political power and commerce with works by Mark Bradford and Andreas Gursky; and works by Julie Mehretu and Robert Longo that take on both global struggle and protest. The artworks on display represent a fraction of the works acquired during the past ten years. Others are on loan to institutions around the globe or stored in the second floor \u201cvault\u201d at the museum. As the collection grows and evolves into the future, The Broad will be guided by the long precedent set by Eli Broad, who collected art over five decades by following so many artists\u2019 journeys with curiosity, intensity, and ultimately, a public purpose.",

I Smell a Rat (1994) \u2013 a pivotal work for the artist, in which he began reusing his own work as an image bank for generating paintings. Untitled (2015) \u2013 a recent painting in which Wool uses digital methods. An outcome of sustained and ongoing engagement with artists and artwork, the Broad collection is distinctive in its exceptional dedication to the full arc of artists\u2019 careers.

The exhibition\u2019s title is taken from Julie Mehretu\u2019s painting Invisible Sun (algorithm 8, fable form) (2015). While not created in response to these specific events, works on view speak to profound transitions both personal and global and form an appeal for healing. Artists included respond to issues such as the AIDS crisis, gender- and race-based violence, unchecked capitalism, and colonialism\u2019s aftermath. They collectively grapple with revolution and change, loss, and recovery, and how the freedoms and prosperity of powerful countries come at the expense of others. The exhibition intends to be a site for reflection, education, and dialogue towards confronting current issues and offering space for contemplating a more just world. \u200b Artists featured include El Anatsui, Alexander Calder, Keith Haring, Jenny Holzer, Julie Mehretu, Nathaniel Mary Quinn, Cindy Sherman, and many others in the Broad collection. The exhibition offers galleries focusing on the work of a single artist or thematic groupings that reflect larger webs of influence. In total, the show features 59 works in the Broad collection. Twenty-four artworks are on view for the first time at the museum, and 16 have been acquired since the museum opened.",

            "venue": "The Broad",
            "description": "Originated by The Broad, Shirin Neshat: I Will Greet the Sun Again is the largest exhibition to date of internationally acclaimed artist Shirin Neshat\u2019s approximately 30-year career. Taking its title from a poem by Iranian poet Forugh Farrokhzad, the exhibition (which presents over 230 photographs and eight immersive video installations works) offers a rare glimpse into the evolution of Neshat\u2019s artistic journey as she explores topics of exile, displacement, and identity with beauty, dynamic formal invention, and poetic grace. Beginning with her early photograph series, Women of Allah, the exhibition also features iconic video works such as Rapture, Turbulent, and Passage, monumental photography installations including The Book of Kings and The Home of My Eyes, and Land of Dreams, a new, ambitious work encompassing a body of photographs and two videos that will make its global debut in the exhibition. Following The Broad's originating presentation, the exhibition will travel to the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth from February 28 until May 16, 2021. Throughout her career, Neshat has constructed poetic worlds in which women and men navigate narratives that mirror interior and political realities. Inside of and against these metaphoric worlds, Neshat studies the specifics of both individual and cultural gestures and poses, often assembling and interviewing real people who have lived through some of the most turbulent events of recent history, including the Green Movement in Iran and the Arab Spring in Egypt. Neshat\u2019s 2001 collaboration with composer Philip Glass, Passage, will act as a pivot in the exhibition from Neshat\u2019s early, personal work made specifically about living outside of Iran during some of the most turbulent times in the country\u2019s history to new bodies of work which reflect universally on seismic global political events such as 9/11, the Arab Spring, and the current xenophobia in the United States over immigration. Four galleries in the exhibition feature work never-before-seen in the United States, including a body of portraits made in Iran that Neshat has never shown publicly. FREE SHIRIN NESHAT: I WILL GREET THE SUN AGAIN OPPORTUNITIES Final Weeks Thursdays: Receive free walk-up access to Shirin Neshat: I Will Greet the Sun Again on all day on January 30, February 6, and February 13 during the final weeks of this critically acclaimed exhibition.

            "description": "Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power 1963-1983 shines a bright light on the vital contribution of Black artists made over two decades, beginning in 1963 at the height of the civil rights movement. Soul of a Nation explores how social justice movements, as well as stylistic evolutions in visual art (such as Minimalism and abstraction), were powerfully expressed in the work of artists including Romare Bearden, Barkley Hendricks, Noah Purifoy, Martin Puryear, Faith Ringgold, Betye Saar, Alma Thomas, Charles White, and William T. Williams. Los Angeles-based artists appear throughout Soul of a Nation, and more deeply in three specific galleries, foregrounding the significant role of Los Angeles in the art and history of the civil rights movement and the subsequent activist era, and the critical influence and sustained originality of the city\u2019s artists, many of whom have lacked wider recognition. Featuring the work of more than 60 influential artists and including vibrant paintings, powerful sculptures, street photography, murals, and more, this landmark exhibition is a rare opportunity to see era-defining artworks that changed the face of art in America. FREE SOUL OF A NATION ACCESS OPPORTUNITIES July & August \u2013 All day every Thursday: Receive free walk-up access to Soul of a Nation every Thursday until August 29. Last entry is at 7 p.m. Join The Broad's free gallery talks on Thursdays that offer unique perspectives on the art, artists, and era of Soul of a Nation from some of the gallerists and cultural leaders who were working during the 1960s through the early 1980s, community activists organizing today in South Los Angeles, and emerging artists who have been influenced by the artists featured in Soul of a Nation. The series was co-curated in part by The Southern California Library. For more information, visit our Events page. Family Weekend Workshops: Families attending these free workshops on May 4-5 and June 8-9 will receive free access to Soul of a Nation with their Family Weekend Workshop wristbands.

Painting, sculpture, photography, film and installation will be brought together to examine the passage of time by alluding to nostalgia or sentiments about aging, often depicting specific places in states of decay. Others imply movement or narrative within single still images; in these works, historical styles and events are ruptured, collaged and recontextualized, like portals into seemingly other worlds.

            "description": "Artist Jordan Wolfson's (Female figure), 2014, is an immersive environment that features a robotic sculpture. For seven minutes, the robot gives monologues and dances to pop songs. Startling and unnerving, the work raises the specter of misogyny and exposes fissures in pop culture. It challenges the ways women are represented, and the ways images of women are consumed. The sculpture resembles a hypersexualized female, but it also complicates such a reading and evades easy consumption. In a brightly lit room that is more sterile than sensual, the robot wears a witch mask and is covered in black smudges. The figure faces a mirrored wall to which it is attached by a rod piercing its torso. Traditionally, art is a one-directional experience: you alone observe the artwork. Here, however, the robot uses facial recognition software to \u201clook at\u201d the viewer, returning your stare. This may feel like the sculpture is objectifying you, treating you like an object. (Female figure) challenges assumptions about gender, sexuality and even our status as human subjects. This artwork has extremely limited capacity and is not suitable for children.",

This exhibition will embark on the most significant North American tour of her work in nearly two decades, and The Broad will be the only California museum to host the exhibition. \u201cThe timing is right for an exhibition that contextualizes the Infinity Mirror Rooms and brings Kusama\u2019s contributions to 20th and 21st century art into deeper focus.\u201d -Joanne Heyler, Founding Director of The Broad Yayoi Kusama: Infinity Mirrors will provide visitors with the unique opportunity to experience six of Kusama\u2019s infinity rooms\u2014the artist\u2019s most iconic kaleidoscopic environments\u2014alongside large-scale installations and key paintings, sculptures and works on paper from the early 1950s to the present, which contextualize the foundational role the concept of infinity has played in the artist\u2019s work over many decades and through diverse media. The traveling exhibition marks the North American debut of numerous new works by the 88-year-old artist, who is still actively creating in her Tokyo studio. These include large-scale, vibrantly colored paintings and her most recent infinity room, All the Eternal Love I Have for the Pumpkins, 2016. \u201cI am deeply interested in trying to understand the relationship between people, society, and nature; and my work is forged from accumulations of these frictions.\u201d Learn more about Yayoi Kusama Yayoi Kusama: Infinity Mirrors is organized by Mika Yoshitake, curator, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.

Opening April 29, 2017, the four-month installation will feature works by over 20 artists including El Anatsui, Mark Bradford, Peter Halley, William Kentridge, Julie Mehretu, Shirin Neshat, Albert Oehlen, Jeff Wall and Terry Winters, plus recent acquisitions by Ericka Beckman, Sterling Ruby, Oscar Murillo, Tauba Auerbach and Andreas Gursky. Four artworks in the installation will make their debut in Los Angeles, including one work completed by the artist this year. From everyday experiences to protest movements as monumental as the Arab Spring uprisings across the Middle East, to themes that probe systems of social control or examine global commerce, artworks in Oracle tackle the effects of organizational frameworks on global events and private individuals. Some works in the installation symbolize marketplace machinations, both official and unofficial, while others are meditations on games, surveillance, vast data sets, mathematical and biological patterns, and even the logic of art itself. Just under the surface of the works in Oracle is an air of anxiety, as if individuals\u2019 freedoms within these manmade phenomena are illusory or beyond reach.",

            "description": "The Broad\u2019s first special exhibition, on view June 11 - October 2, 2016, was a comprehensive survey of the work of artist Cindy Sherman. Cindy Sherman: Imitation of Life was the first major museum show of Sherman\u2019s work in Los Angeles in nearly 20 years, and the exhibition filled The Broad\u2019s first-floor galleries with 120 works drawn primarily from the Broad collection with key loans from other institutions. \u201cCindy Sherman\u2019s work has been a touchstone for the Broad collection since Eli and Edye Broad first encountered it in 1982, and Cindy is the only artist in the collection whose work we\u2019ve acquired so deeply and regularly, for more than 30 years,\u201d said Joanne Heyler, founding director of The Broad. \u201cThere are 127 Cindy Sherman photographs in the Broad collection, the largest holding of her work in the world, and inaugurating our special exhibitions with an artist whose work sparked the Broads\u2019 deep commitment to contemporary art could not be more appropriate for us.\" Most well-known for photographs that feature the artist as her own model playing out media-influenced female stereotypes in a range of personas, environments, and guises, Sherman shoots alone in her studio, serving as director, photographer, make-up artist, hairstylist, and subject. Her decades-long performative practice has produced many of contemporary art\u2019s most iconic and influential images. In her work, Sherman proposes powerful questions about identity, representation, and the role of images in contemporary culture. From screen siren and pin-up to socialite and businesswoman, the roles Sherman depicts through her monumental body of work provocatively engage with contemporary life\u2019s mediated personas and stereotypes, drawing not only from art history but also from the histories of advertising, cinema, and media. Organized by guest curator Philipp Kaiser, and taking cues from Los Angeles\u2019 role as the mecca of the film industry, this exhibition foregrounded Cindy Sherman's engagement with 20th century popular film and celebrity. The exhibition featured an expansive representation of Sherman\u2019s photographs from throughout her influential career of more than four decades, as well as Office Killer, the 1997 feature film directed by the artist. Her widely known Untitled Film Stills series, as well as the less known rear projection series, both inspired by cinema of the 1950s and 1960s, played a central conceptual role in the show, and the show included many works never before exhibited in Los Angeles. \u201cShe is one of the most important artists of our time, with a body of work that exemplifies the Pictures Generation\u2014artists whose work came to fruition in the age of the proliferation of mass media imagery in the \u201880s, which is relevant to today\u2019s image-saturated world,\u201d said Kaiser.",
