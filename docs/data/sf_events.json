Inspired by the Hebrew phrase l\u2019chaim (\u201cto life\u201d), used most often as a toast to mark moments of togetherness and celebration, the architecture of The CJM\u2019s building embodies the values, traditions, and ideas The Museum explores within its walls.

The resulting exhibition brings together the work of forty-seven artists reflecting on their connection to Judaism, the world, and their own history. Through a wide range of media, including paintings, sculptures, interactive video games, video works, photographs, and more, the California Jewish Open illustrates some of the myriad ways in which these artists\u2019 Jewish identity informs their connection to the world at large\u2014and offers a window into the universal human need for connection in all its complexity.",

The legend of the golem originates as far back as the Middle Ages, when Jewish mystics imagined the creation of a clay humanoid as a meditative technique for becoming closer to God. By the nineteenth century, popular Yiddish folktales characterized the golem as a helper, companion, or rescuer of an imperiled Jewish community. In this exhibition, Weitz revitalizes golem mythology to frame a moral imperative for action on the social and ecological issues we face today.",

These minutely edited snippets of music played by soloists found on the Internet are displayed on twelve monitors that periodically join in or go silent.",

Mima\u2018amaqim , translated alternatively as \u201cfrom [or out of] the depths\u201d or de profundis , is a concept that evokes deep valleys, dark places, and mysteries. For several months, David worked in the deep storage of the Magnes, finding, researching, looking at, and drawing objects from the four corners of the world. Each drawing session culminated in a conversation with Francesco, who expanded on and played with the origins and meanings of the objects he portrayed. This installation is the result of their collaboration. Artifacts, drawings, and annotations open a window into the process of bringing out the life of an object, unleashing its performative powers. The conversation is by all means not over.",

The objects on view range from those associated with daily ritual, such as the mezuzah , to more festival-specific objects, such as the etrog box used during the harvest festival of Sukkoth. Rendered in metal and inspired by the architect\u2019s commitment to a modernist aesthetic, this collection is characterized by the clean lines, rational proportions, and smooth, unembellished surfaces that also define Saitowitz\u2019s architecture.",

The subject of this invitational, the tzedakah box (or pushke in Yiddish), is a traditionally humble container found in synagogues, Jewish homes and institutions in which charitable donations are deposited. This ritual object was chosen because it represents a tradition which embodies community outreach, service and empowerment to others. Hebrew for \"righteousness,\" tzedakah is the act of charity in Jewish culture and faith.",

Initiated by Polish artist Dorota Mytych and created with painting collaborators Tracy Grubbs (San Francisco), Jessica Houston (Canada), and Marcia Teusink (UK), the installation features the four artists jointly recreating a total of fifty-nine looted artworks based on documentation from the Polish government catalogue of wartime losses. Watching this mesmerizing process comes with an unexpected conclusion: before each canvas can dry, the artists wipe away their own painstaking work in a stunning erasure that challenges the meaning of authorship, ownership, and recovery. Paintings by Raphael, Rembrandt van Rijn, Peter Paul Rubens, and others are infinitely recreated and erased, offering new ways to process the impact of these stolen works and experience art as a means for resilience.",

One of the headlining artists, Malvika Raj, is a Dalit artist who challenges the casteist restrictions present in the Madhubani style of painting, by incorporating pro-Dalit assertions into her intricate and hypnotizing designs. Nazrina Rodjan is a queer Indo-Surinamese artist who integrates the history of indentured labor and femme resilience within her large paintings of indentured Indian women.\nLondon-based trans Dalit artist Mya Mehmi from Pxssy Palace will be one of four guest DJs and performers at the opening reception dance party in collaboration with Discostan\u2019s Arshia Fatima Haq. Dalit Dreamlands is a historic event that marks one of the first queer Dalit-centered spaces to exist in California.\n*Dalit is a caste marker for caste-oppressed communities formerly known as Untouchables, Adivasi refers to tribes who are indigenous to South Asia, and Bahujan is an umbrella term that includes all caste-oppressed communities.\n \nCURATOR\nManu Kaur\nEXHIBITING ARTISTS\nRinku Kumari, Jessie Sohpaul, Shivam Kamble, Nazrina Rodjan, Manpreet Singh, Malvika Raj, Seema Mattu, Mya Mehmi, Seema Hari, Shyama Kuver, Akhil Kang, Kaushik Tadvi, Rahee Punyashloka, Aravind Chedayan, Ajay Madhukar Dhoke, Shweta Ashokraj, Kamna Singh, Anika Nawar Ullah, Aindriya Barua, Ramnath Siddi, Siddi Tribe of Karnataka, Nrithya Pillai, Dalit Queer Project, Parth Pawar, Imaan Abbasi, Sri Vamsi Matta, R V Purusothaman (Purushu Arie), Shradha Raj, Jay Sagathia, Dee Chawla, Mia Kaur, Riri Kumbhar, Rohini bhadarge, John Spencer, Kulpreet Rana, & Simrah Farrukh\nEvent graphic by Parth Pawar.\n",

Being too attached to a place or way of being can make it hard to form connections to anything new. But our connection to a place is also related to our quality of life and well-being\u2013 it links us to neighborhoods and communities where we have lived.  Anyone who has migrated from another country or grown up in an immigrant family knows these attachments run deep and true, not needing to be present to have a prominent place in our hearts.   \n\nWe invite you to join us in reflection of our relationships to attachment, and to celebrate these Bay Area refugee, immigrant, and children of immigrant artists.\n",

            "description": "\nAsian American Women Artists Association (AAWAA), ARTogether, Discostan, and Oakland Asian Cultural Center co-presents \u201cDalit Dreamlands: Toward an Anti-Caste Future\u201d \u2013 a landmark multimedia Dalit art exhibition and dance party that will bring together over 30 multiply marginalized artists from Dalit*, Adivasi*, Bahujan*, Afro-Indian, Indo-Caribbean, and Muslim communities to showcase the depths of creativity and community.\nDalit Dreamlands, curated by Manu Kaur (they/them) and supported through AAWAA\u2019s Emerging Curator\u2019s Program, will center queer and trans caste abolitionist futurisms through art across various mediums, including fashion design, music, performances, films, paintings and visuals. One of the headlining artists, Malvika Raj, is a Dalit artist who challenges the casteist restrictions present in the Madhubani style of painting, by incorporating pro-Dalit assertions into her intricate and hypnotizing designs. Nazrina Rodjan is a queer Indo-Surinamese artist who integrates the history of indentured labor and femme resilience within her large paintings of indentured Indian women.\nLondon-based trans Dalit artist Mya Mehmi from Pxssy Palace will be one of four guest DJs and performers at the opening reception dance party in collaboration with Discostan\u2019s Arshia Fatima Haq. Dalit Dreamlands is a historic event that marks one of the first queer Dalit-centered spaces to exist in California.\n*Dalit is a caste marker for caste-oppressed communities formerly known as Untouchables, Adivasi refers to tribes who are indigenous to South Asia, and Bahujan is an umbrella term that includes all caste-oppressed communities.\n \nCURATOR\nManu Kaur\nEXHIBITING ARTISTS\nRinku Kumari, Jessie Sohpaul, Shivam Kamble, Nazrina Rodjan, Manpreet Singh, Malvika Raj, Seema Mattu, Mya Mehmi, Seema Hari, Shyama Kuver, Akhil Kang, Kaushik Tadvi, Rahee Punyashloka, Aravind Chedayan, Ajay Madhukar Dhoke, Shweta Ashokraj, Kamna Singh, Anika Nawar Ullah, Aindriya Barua, Ramnath Siddi, Siddi Tribe of Karnataka, Nrithya Pillai, Dalit Queer Project, Parth Pawar, Imaan Abbasi, Sri Vamsi Matta, R V Purusothaman (Purushu Arie), Shradha Raj, Jay Sagathia, Dee Chawla, Mia Kaur, Riri Kumbhar, Rohini bhadarge, John Spencer, Kulpreet Rana, & Simrah Farrukh\nEvent graphic by Parth Pawar.\n",
