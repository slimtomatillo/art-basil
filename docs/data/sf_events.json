They are also a critical time in the creation of what psychologists from the Family Narrative Lab at Emory University call the \u201cintergenerational self\u201d\u2014a self embedded in a larger family history. What shapes us? Which family histories become our core stories? How do we make them our own? Over fifty teens, ranging in age from twelve to nineteen years old, created audio works reflecting on these questions and exploring themes including migration, language, rebellion, persistence, and passion.",

By the nineteenth century, popular Yiddish folktales characterized the golem as a helper, companion, or rescuer of an imperiled Jewish community. In this exhibition, Weitz revitalizes golem mythology to frame a moral imperative for action on the social and ecological issues we face today.",

Spanning twenty feet in diameter, Negev Wheel is an immense, slowly spinning disc filled with sand from the Negev desert in Israel; the piece presents an ever-changing, mesmerizing image of tumbling change. The sand from that region is made of a mixture of sands from a great many geographic sources, representing complexity within unity and constant evolution within permanence.",

Mima\u2018amaqim , translated alternatively as \u201cfrom [or out of] the depths\u201d or de profundis , is a concept that evokes deep valleys, dark places, and mysteries. For several months, David worked in the deep storage of the Magnes, finding, researching, looking at, and drawing objects from the four corners of the world. Each drawing session culminated in a conversation with Francesco, who expanded on and played with the origins and meanings of the objects he portrayed. This installation is the result of their collaboration. Artifacts, drawings, and annotations open a window into the process of bringing out the life of an object, unleashing its performative powers. The conversation is by all means not over.",

The objects on view range from those associated with daily ritual, such as the mezuzah , to more festival-specific objects, such as the etrog box used during the harvest festival of Sukkoth. Rendered in metal and inspired by the architect\u2019s commitment to a modernist aesthetic, this collection is characterized by the clean lines, rational proportions, and smooth, unembellished surfaces that also define Saitowitz\u2019s architecture.",

            "description": "Marking the first time the space has been activated in this way since the building\u2019s opening, Bay Area artist Leah Rosenberg transforms The CJM\u2019s Yud Gallery through light and color, creating a welcoming environment for visitors to reflect, rest, and wonder. In When One Sees a Rainbow , Rosenberg fills the gallery\u2014a space itself created to celebrate light and its connection to Judaism\u2014with new hues, exploring how the wondrous natural phenomenon of rainbows connects to our lives, light, and meditative practice. Inspired by the Jewish tradition of reciting a blessing upon seeing a rainbow, visitors will also be invited to create their own responses to the colors on view in the gallery. Enter a kaleidoscopic world of color and rediscover a familiar symbol of hope and awe.",

Inspired by the concept of the firmament\u2014a dividing form referenced in the Torah that separated the earth from the heavens\u2014Green reimagines the gallery space as an environment of welcome and liberation centering trans and nonbinary bodies. Artworks rendered primarily in clay feature motifs that invoke fermentation, mycelium, and reinvented ritual as metaphors for regeneration, transformation, and resilience\u2014concepts that have informed Jewish thinking and practice for thousands of years. By reclaiming parts of her Jewish upbringing, reinventing functional forms of ceramic objects, and reimagining ways of embracing different genders and sexualities, Green challenges and expands the binary limits of our society.",

            "description": "Uncovering powerful insights into the relationships between art, memory, politics, and loss, this multimedia installation reflects on the history of Polish-owned paintings stolen during the Nazi occupation in World War II. Initiated by Polish artist Dorota Mytych and created with painting collaborators Tracy Grubbs (San Francisco), Jessica Houston (Canada), and Marcia Teusink (UK), the installation features the four artists jointly recreating a total of fifty-nine looted artworks based on documentation from the Polish government catalogue of wartime losses. Watching this mesmerizing process comes with an unexpected conclusion: before each canvas can dry, the artists wipe away their own painstaking work in a stunning erasure that challenges the meaning of authorship, ownership, and recovery. Paintings by Raphael, Rembrandt van Rijn, Peter Paul Rubens, and others are infinitely recreated and erased, offering new ways to process the impact of these stolen works and experience art as a means for resilience.",

One of the headlining artists, Malvika Raj, is a Dalit artist who challenges the casteist restrictions present in the Madhubani style of painting, by incorporating pro-Dalit assertions into her intricate and hypnotizing designs. Nazrina Rodjan is a queer Indo-Surinamese artist who integrates the history of indentured labor and femme resilience within her large paintings of indentured Indian women.\nLondon-based trans Dalit artist Mya Mehmi from Pxssy Palace will be one of four guest DJs and performers at the opening reception dance party in collaboration with Discostan\u2019s Arshia Fatima Haq. Dalit Dreamlands is a historic event that marks one of the first queer Dalit-centered spaces to exist in California.\n*Dalit is a caste marker for caste-oppressed communities formerly known as Untouchables, Adivasi refers to tribes who are indigenous to South Asia, and Bahujan is an umbrella term that includes all caste-oppressed communities.\n \nCURATOR\nManu Kaur\nEXHIBITING ARTISTS\nRinku Kumari, Jessie Sohpaul, Shivam Kamble, Nazrina Rodjan, Manpreet Singh, Malvika Raj, Seema Mattu, Mya Mehmi, Seema Hari, Shyama Kuver, Akhil Kang, Kaushik Tadvi, Rahee Punyashloka, Aravind Chedayan, Ajay Madhukar Dhoke, Shweta Ashokraj, Kamna Singh, Anika Nawar Ullah, Aindriya Barua, Ramnath Siddi, Siddi Tribe of Karnataka, Nrithya Pillai, Dalit Queer Project, Parth Pawar, Imaan Abbasi, Sri Vamsi Matta, R V Purusothaman (Purushu Arie), Shradha Raj, Jay Sagathia, Dee Chawla, Mia Kaur, Riri Kumbhar, Rohini bhadarge, John Spencer, Kulpreet Rana, & Simrah Farrukh\nEvent graphic by Parth Pawar.\n",

Being too attached to a place or way of being can make it hard to form connections to anything new. But our connection to a place is also related to our quality of life and well-being\u2013 it links us to neighborhoods and communities where we have lived.  Anyone who has migrated from another country or grown up in an immigrant family knows these attachments run deep and true, not needing to be present to have a prominent place in our hearts.   \n\nWe invite you to join us in reflection of our relationships to attachment, and to celebrate these Bay Area refugee, immigrant, and children of immigrant artists.\n",

One of the headlining artists, Malvika Raj, is a Dalit artist who challenges the casteist restrictions present in the Madhubani style of painting, by incorporating pro-Dalit assertions into her intricate and hypnotizing designs. Nazrina Rodjan is a queer Indo-Surinamese artist who integrates the history of indentured labor and femme resilience within her large paintings of indentured Indian women.\nLondon-based trans Dalit artist Mya Mehmi from Pxssy Palace will be one of four guest DJs and performers at the opening reception dance party in collaboration with Discostan\u2019s Arshia Fatima Haq. Dalit Dreamlands is a historic event that marks one of the first queer Dalit-centered spaces to exist in California.\n*Dalit is a caste marker for caste-oppressed communities formerly known as Untouchables, Adivasi refers to tribes who are indigenous to South Asia, and Bahujan is an umbrella term that includes all caste-oppressed communities.\n \nCURATOR\nManu Kaur\nEXHIBITING ARTISTS\nRinku Kumari, Jessie Sohpaul, Shivam Kamble, Nazrina Rodjan, Manpreet Singh, Malvika Raj, Seema Mattu, Mya Mehmi, Seema Hari, Shyama Kuver, Akhil Kang, Kaushik Tadvi, Rahee Punyashloka, Aravind Chedayan, Ajay Madhukar Dhoke, Shweta Ashokraj, Kamna Singh, Anika Nawar Ullah, Aindriya Barua, Ramnath Siddi, Siddi Tribe of Karnataka, Nrithya Pillai, Dalit Queer Project, Parth Pawar, Imaan Abbasi, Sri Vamsi Matta, R V Purusothaman (Purushu Arie), Shradha Raj, Jay Sagathia, Dee Chawla, Mia Kaur, Riri Kumbhar, Rohini bhadarge, John Spencer, Kulpreet Rana, & Simrah Farrukh\nEvent graphic by Parth Pawar.\n",
