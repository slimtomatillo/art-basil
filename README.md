# Art Basil
You may have heard of Art Basel ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Basel), [art basel site](https://www.artbasel.com/?lang=en))...but have you heard of Art Basil?

**Purpose**  
This project aims to create and populate (with fresh data!) a website that lists upcoming art events in your area.

**Scope**  
- *Location:* I will start with **San Francisco Bay Area** as that is my area.
- *Events:* Art shows + art-related events (e.g. workshops, talks, tours) at museums, gallieries, and colleges/universities.

**Inspiration**  
This project was inspired by and is largely based on [19hz.info](https://19hz.info/eventlisting_BayArea.php) that has local listings for electronic music events.
