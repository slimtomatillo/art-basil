# Art Basil
You may have heard of Art Basel ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Basel), [art basel site](https://www.artbasel.com/?lang=en))...but have you heard of Art Basil?

**Purpose**  
This project aims to create and populate (with fresh data!) a website that lists upcoming art events in your area.

**Scope**  
- *Location:* **San Francisco Bay Area** and **Greater Los Angeles** for now, more regions coming soon!
- *Events:* Art shows + art-related events (e.g. workshops, talks, tours) at museums, galleries, and colleges/universities.

**Acknowledgements**  
- This project was inspired by [19hz.info](https://19hz.info/eventlisting_BayArea.php) which has local listings for electronic music events.
- Thank you to [Chris Nager](https://github.com/chrisnager/) for the [squirtle cursor](https://github.com/chrisnager/cursors/blob/gh-pages/squirtle.cur)! You can see some of Chris's other curors in his [repo](https://github.com/chrisnager/cursors).
